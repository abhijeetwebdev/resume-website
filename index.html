      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I have over 9 years of experience working in web-based product and service software development. I worked in startup environments where I got opportunities to work as a Full-stack Developer, primarily on MEAN and LAMP stack based technologies.</p>
      <p>I am a curious learner. I like exploring new technologies and bringing the ideas into reality. I have created prototypes for ideas like YouTube Remote Control, developed a Socket.IO and Arduino based application for an art installation at KalaGhoda Art festival, created jQuery based plugins and Raspberry Pie based interactive applications as well.</p>
